# SpringBoot + MySQL basic setup

This repo can serve as a starter for people struggling with connecting your MySQL database with springboot and successfully performing CRUD operations on the database though REST API endpoints defined in our Spring application.

It also has test.html to test the working of add employee function.
You can also test the API's and their functionality using Postman or any other testing tool you would like


Database table used for this setup was simple Employee table with two columns employeeId - primary key , name

One thing to keep in mind is to update the fields inside application.properties file under resources accordingly -
* Database name
* user name
* password

Lastly Check out the dependencies used in the pom.xml and follow up...
